# HorseTrust2

## Problem

Buying a horse is a high-risk, high-cost transaction often marred by a lack of transparency regarding medical history, performance data, and seller credibility. Current marketplaces are essentially "classified ads" with no verification

## Description

How do we build a high-trust environment? This project should focus on "Verified Listings," integrating veterinary records, video proof of performance, and secure communication channels to reduce the risk of "lemon" sales in the horse world.
